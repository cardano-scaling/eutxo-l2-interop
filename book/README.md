## Background

### Research

[State Machines across Isomorphic Layer 2 Ledgers](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1027.pdf) is a central piece of research that this project evaluates.


..builds on top of previous work about [Interhead Hydra](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1188) where full virtual Hydra state channels were created.
